# eslint-config-vitkon

Common ESLint config encourages consistent style and quality across all of my repos.

The lion's share of ESLint configuration should be defined here rather than each project's own .eslintrc.
If a project's maintainers want to override some configuration value, they can do it in their own .eslintrc
